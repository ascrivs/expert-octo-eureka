    "<h4> Hypothesis and Root Exploration Cause</h4>\n",
    "<p> Due to the increase in television funding, the Premier League is experiencing an staggering inflation of player valuation. As a player value increases, I believe there is a point where market value outstrips the return on investment for what an individual player can bring to the club. More specifically, as a player projected value increases, it attracts more scouting attention thus further inflating the player demand and valuation. This EDA will explore at what value per position is a player statistically the best buy. As a secondary point, a commonly discussed issue known as \"The English Tax\" relates to a massive overvaluation of domestic players. Is this true when also comparing international players with very similar features?\n",
